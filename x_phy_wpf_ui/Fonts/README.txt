Add Roboto font files here (extracted from the Roboto font family zip).

Required: At least Roboto-Regular.ttf (or Roboto.ttf) for normal text.
Optional: Roboto-Bold.ttf, Roboto-Medium.ttf, Roboto-Light.ttf for best rendering.

Extract your zip and copy the .ttf files into this Fonts folder.
The app will embed them and use "Roboto" as the app font.
